"""Create a program that computes the "Tribonacci" sequence numbers
Unlike the traditional Fibonacci sequence (a number is the sum of the two previous ones), here a number is the sum of the three previous ones (the initial numbers are 1,1,1)

The first 9 elements of the sequence are:
1, 1, 1, 3, 5, 9, 17, 31, 57, â€¦

Your program should asks the user a positive Integer n and the deliver the n-th element of the Tribonacci sequence"""
